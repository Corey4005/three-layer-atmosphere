# three-layer-atmosphere

This is an object-oriented model to simulate the radiation budget in the atmosphere across three layers and associated temperature effects. This model was created by Dr. John R. Christy and M.P. Singh of the University of Alabama Huntsville. 

| Script         | Purpose     |
| ---------------| ------------|
| [Model Class](https://github.com/Corey4005/three-layer-atmosphere/blob/main/model/modelEquations.py) | A class to model three atmospheric layers and associated methods. |
| [Simulate Cloud Cover](https://github.com/Corey4005/three-layer-atmosphere/blob/main/model/model_cirrus_clouds.py) | This module demonstrates how the model can be iterated upon to simulate temperature changes in the upper atmosphere with increasing cirrus cloud cover. Returns a plot of temperature changes at each layer over small changes with reflectivity. |
| [Calculate Layer Temps](https://github.com/Corey4005/three-layer-atmosphere/blob/main/model/model_temps_with_input.py) | This is a module to show how a text file containing solar and infrared values for each layer can be read in and processed to model temperatures. Returns a print statement containing the calculated temperatures from radiation inputs. |
| [Model Greenhouse Effect](https://github.com/Corey4005/three-layer-atmosphere/blob/main/model/model_varying_CO2.py) | This is a module to simulate changing CO2 and its effect on the layer temperatures. Injection of CO2 into the troposphere causes increased reflectance of infrared and decresed absorption. Returns a plot of layer temperatures with changing infrared reflectance. |
| [Model Aerosols in Upper Atmosphere](https://github.com/Corey4005/three-layer-atmosphere/blob/main/model/model_varying_L1_reflectance.py) | This is a module to demonstrate the effect of small changes in solar reflectivity in the stratosphere and absorption on the surface temperature. This would occur with the stratosphere being injected with aerosols that increase solar reflection and decrease solar transmission. Returns a plot of varying solar reflectance with temperature. | 
| [Model Aerosols in Lower Atmosphere](https://github.com/Corey4005/three-layer-atmosphere/blob/main/model/model_varying_L2_reflectance.py) | This is a module to demonstrate the effect of small changes in solar reflectivity in the troposphere and absorption on the surface temperature. This is to simulate the effect of aerosols on the troposphere. Returns a plot after increasing solar reflectance and decreasing solar absorption. |
| [Calculate Stratospheric Sensitivity](https://github.com/Corey4005/three-layer-atmosphere/blob/main/model/simulate_warming_cooling_stratosphere.py) | This module calculates surface sensitivity to temperature change in relation to solar radiation and transmission in the stratosphere. |
| [Calculate Surface Sensitivity](https://github.com/Corey4005/three-layer-atmosphere/blob/main/model/simulate_warming_cooling_surface.py) | This module calculates surface sensitivity of temperature in relation to solar radiation and absorption at the surface. |
| [Calculate Tropospheric Sensitivity](https://github.com/Corey4005/three-layer-atmosphere/blob/main/model/simulate_warming_cooling_troposphere.py) | This module calculates surface surface sensitivity to temperature change in relation to solar reflectivity and transmission. |

# Model Equations 

The model uses the functions in the [Model Class](https://github.com/Corey4005/three-layer-atmosphere/blob/main/model/modelEquations.py) module to derive new temperatures. `calculateRadiationBudget()` takes in the coeficients of absorption, transmission and reflection from a choice of textfiles and calculates net short and longwave radiation budgets. These calculations are then used by `getTemperatures()` to solve a linear algebra matrix for coeficients used for temperature calculations across each layer. Reading [`modelEquations.py`](https://github.com/Corey4005/three-layer-atmosphere/blob/main/model/modelEquations.py) from top to bottom should provide a clear idea of how calculations are performed.
